  ## Description
  The Quality of a good README often makes the difference between a good project and a bad project. A good one explains and showcases what the application does, list the technology used, and explain some of the challenges you've face. Theres no one right way of writing a good README. But there is one wrong way which is not writing one at all. But with this README generator your problems are solved and you can make a quality README quickly.
